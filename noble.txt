what is scatting in cv ramen effict
In the context of the Raman effect, scattering refers to the interaction between light and matter, where the light changes direction and may also experience a change in energy. Specifically, Raman scattering is the inelastic scattering of photons, which results in a shift in the photon's energy due to the exchange of energy with the molecule. This energy exchange provides valuable information about the vibrational, rotational, and other low-frequency modes in a system, allowing scientists to analyze the chemical composition and structure of substances.



what is photons
Photons in the context of Raman spectroscopy are particles of light thatshowing both wave-like and particle-like properties. They carry energy proportional to the frequency of the radiation. In Raman spectroscopy, a source of monochromatic light, usually from a laser, is used. The laser light interacts with molecular vibrations, phonons or other excitations in the system, resulting in the energy of the laser photons being shifted up or down. The shift in energy gives information about the vibrational modes in the system.
